Changes Made to ST9x FWLib
--------------------------

Philip Munts, 9 July 2008

1. Downloaded um0233.zip, version 1.0 January 2008, from www.st.com.

2. Copied source and header files to this subdirectory.

3. Removed trailing DOS CR's from each source and header file.

4. Eliminated 91x_it.c.  ISR stubs are provided by linker.ld instead,
   and may be overridden by routines declared in user source files.
   See test_timer1.c for an example.

5. Added some parantheses to 91x_adc.c to avoid a gcc compiler warning.

6. Modified 91x_tim.c to reset the counter to 0x0000, not 0x1234.

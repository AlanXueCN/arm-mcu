Changes Made to ST9x USB Developer Kit
--------------------------------------

1.  Downloaded um0290.zip, version 1.0 January 2007, from www.st.com.

2.  Copied source and header files to this subdirectory.

3.  Removed trailing DOS CR's from each source and header file.

4.  Eliminated 91x_it.c.  ISR stubs are provided by linker.ld instead,
    and may be overridden by routines declared in user source files.

5.  Eliminated 91x_conf.h, hw_config.h, hw_config.c, and main.c.

6.  Added parantheses to usb_regs.h to avoid gcc compiler warnings.

7.  Removed unnecessary #include "hw_config.h" from usb_endp.c.

8.  Modified usb_prop.c to remove hw_config.h, remove UART0 configuration,
    and remove USB device configuration wait loop.

9.  Modified usb_pwr.c to include usb_serial.h (for USB_Cable_Config) instead
    of hw_config.h.

10. Added usb_serial.c and usb_serial.h.
